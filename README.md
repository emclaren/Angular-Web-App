Mars colony app created as the fourth project for the Web Development program at RED academy in Vancouver.

This project was to develop a single page web app with AnglarJS. The forms on the 'checkin' and 'report' pages implement ajax GET and POST requests using Angular’s $http service. Angular’s ng-animate module is used to create animated page transitions. The site can be viewed online at the following URL: http://emclaren.github.io/RED-Academy---Project-2/
